		"description": "I'm a student from Río Cuarto - Córdoba. I consider myself to be a self-teaching person with critical thinking skills who loves to be in front of a computer, those three factors led me to develop a vocation for programming. At this moment I'm primarily focused on front-end with React, although I also have some knowledge and experience working with NodeJS and Express. I'd like to keep developing a MERN Stack Developer profile in the future.",
